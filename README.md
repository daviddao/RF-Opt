# RF-Opt

## Introduction

The aim of the project is to implement a fast tree correction algorithm for
reducing the RF distance between a large taxonomy and a large set of smaller
but more accurate phylogenies.
The implementation should:

* have an open source code with an appropriate source license.
* 64-bit multi-threaded design that handles very large datasets.
* multi-thread support.
